							Architecture
							The Corniche skyline alone is a piece of art unique to this countryâ€™s must see features. Be it the Qatar National Convention Center shaped like the branches of a tree by Arata Isozaki, National Museum of Qatar designed like the petals of a desert rose by Jean Nouvel, or the Al Thumama Stuadium designed like the cap worn by Arab men by Ibrahim M Jaidah, this country has plenty of architectural gems to enjoy.
