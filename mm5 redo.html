						<h2>Who am i?</h2>
						<p>I am in second year at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Lesotho. We are family of five members. My father is an architect and my mother is a teacher. I have two siblings who are younger than me. I am someone who is an extremely shy and quiet person. This often makes people misunderstand that i cannot speak confidently. But, it is not true as i have immense knowledge on differrent things. However, i like to asses the place and situation before speaking.</p>

			<h2>My first day at Limkokwing</h2>
			<p>Every person has different memories in their life which can never be forgotten. My first day at Limkokwing is one such memory to remember forever. The day was 13th September 2021, the day i first stepped into university. I was very young then. Mother brought me to school on time that day. As soon as i arrived at university, i found myself in a completely unfamiliar place. As if an unknown fear worked in the mind. I feel very helpless in the crowd of students</p>
