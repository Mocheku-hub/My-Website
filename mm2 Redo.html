						<h2>Dancing to kill</h2>
						<p>
							My parents often make fun of my hobby, dancing. It is all good-natured fun because I am really good at it. I had the dancing bug since I was a child. I would wiggle and jump to any music that played near me. Sometimes even to the microwave timer!

							My mother is unsure who I got the dancing gene from, but my father thinks it’s from my grandmother. She was an exquisite Kathak dancer. Kathak is a classical Indian dance which is performed to the beat of drums as an enactment of a story. It is similar to a performance art routine done in America.

							I am a more contemporary dancer. I sign up to dance classes to learn as many types of dances I can. Dancing is a good hobby because it keeps me in shape. Dance routines are similar to exercises and they keep me active. I have more flexibility and agility since I started dancing. I aim to become a dance choreographer for the film industry but to get there I have to learn all dances. A dance performanceincorporates numerous moves from various types of dances. Different moves require different steps, and if you aren’t practiced in those steps you pose the risk of injuring yourself.

							Because of this risk, it is crucial to stay in shape, practice regularly and stay healthy. Dancing requires fitness; mentally and physically. When I dance I try to forget my worries and just live in the moment. Recently, dancing has gained more popularity as programs are offered for kids to learn dance. Certain instructors attract clients by putting their performances online. Social media has played an important role in promoting dance routines, schools and instructors. It is also easy to learn new moves through videos available online. Many people make a living as professional dancers through classes, music contracts or by entering dance competitions.
