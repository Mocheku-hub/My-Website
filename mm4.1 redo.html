						<h2>Softball</h2>
						<p>
							Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball on a smaller field. Softball is played competitively at club levels, the college level, and the professional level. The game was first created in 1887 in Chicago by George Hancock. It is also a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of 9 players.
